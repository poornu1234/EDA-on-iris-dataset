first the dataset was collected from kaggle (in csv) format . generated  an interactive scatter plot that helps in visualizing the relationship between two selected features (like sepal length vs sepal width).The pair plot shows scatter plots for all pairs of numerical columns in the dataset. It's useful for understanding the pairwise relationships between features.
The hue='Species' adds color to differentiate the species in the dataset.The correlation heatmap shows the correlation between numerical features in the dataset.Box plot helps to compare the distribution of features across various categories
